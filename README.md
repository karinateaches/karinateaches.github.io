## Pages
Add pages to the `_pages/` folder. They will appear at the top navigation bar if and only if:

This block is present at the top of `_pages/example-page.md`

```yaml
---
layout: single
title: "Example-Page"
permalink: /example-page/
author_profile: true
---
```

And the page is added to `_data/navigation.yml`
```yaml
main:
  - title: "About"
    url: /about/
  - title: "Resume"
    url: /resume/
  - title: "Example-Page"
    url: /example-page/
```

You can change the theme by editing `_config.yml`. The first configuration

```yaml
minimal_mistakes_skin  :"dark" # "air", "aqua", "contrast", "dark", "dirt", "neon", "mint", "plum", "sunrise"
```

Simply replace `"dark"` with any of the follow commented out theme names.
